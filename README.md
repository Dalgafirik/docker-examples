# Docker Examples Lab 

This repository is a hands-on Docker learning lab created as part of my transition
into the **DevOps** field.

The goal of this project is to build small, focused, and realistic Docker examples
that demonstrate core containerization concepts used in real-world systems.

---

## Current Scope

- Standalone Docker examples
- Focus on core Docker fundamentals
- Clear and minimal setup for each scenario
- Emphasis on operational understanding rather than application complexity

---

## Examples

### MySQL & phpMyAdmin
- MySQL database running in a Docker container
- Data persistence using Docker volumes
- phpMyAdmin for database management
- Container-to-container communication via Docker networking

---

## Tech Stack

- Docker
- Docker CLI
- MySQL
- phpMyAdmin

---

## Project Structure

```text
docker-examples/
├── mysql-phpmyadmin/
│   └── README.md             # MySQL & phpMyAdmin Docker example
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Running Locally

Each example contains its own README with step-by-step instructions.

Navigate to the desired example directory and follow the documented commands.

---

## Notes

This repository focuses on practical Docker usage, clean documentation,
and reproducible examples that reflect real DevOps workflows rather than
theoretical demonstrations.
